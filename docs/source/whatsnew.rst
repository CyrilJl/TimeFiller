============

Version 1.0.7 (October 26th 2024)
---------------------------------
- Add the ``ExtremeLearningMachine`` estimator, which provides a computationally efficient way
to leverage non-linear relationships between covariates and the time series for imputation. Still
3x slower than ``Ridge``.
